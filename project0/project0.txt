       --version
	      output version information and exit

       FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences are:

EXIT(3)			   Linux Programmer's Manual		       EXIT(3)

NAME
       exit - cause normal process termination

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void exit(int status);

DESCRIPTION
       The  exit()  function  causes  normal process termination and the least
       significant byte of status (i.e., status & 0xFF)	 is  returned  to  the
       parent (see wait(2)).

       All  functions  registered with atexit(3) and on_exit(3) are called, in
       the reverse order of their registration.	 (It is possible  for  one  of
       these  functions	 to  use  atexit(3) or on_exit(3) to register an addi‐
       tional function to be executed during exit processing; the  new	regis‐
       tration	is  added to the front of the list of functions that remain to
       be called.)  If one of these functions does not return (e.g., it	 calls
       _exit(2),  or  kills  itself with a signal), then none of the remaining
       functions is called, and further exit processing (in particular, flush‐

GCC(1)				      GNU				GCC(1)

NAME
       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

SYNOPSIS
       gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]
	   [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]
	   [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]
	   [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
	   [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]
	   [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]
	   [-o outfile] [@file] infile...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
       remainder.  g++ accepts mostly the same options as gcc.

DESCRIPTION
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
       assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
       process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not
       to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by
       the assembler.
